Description: # timelibWAM
        
        timelibWAM is a library meant to alert the user about the 
        completion of a program. This can work best with larger
        projects in which may take longer periods of time to 
        finish running. The package can also alert the user
        about errors that occur.
        
        **IMPORTANT:**
          When utilizing the library, run the import statement by itself. After 
          completing the entry, run the rest of your code. You will incur errors otherwise!
        
        **Best Setup:**
        Copy and paste this bad boy:
        
        ===================================
        
        from timelibWAM import *
        
              try:
                  s = tl.start() 
        
                  *your code*
                  
                  tl.send_frame_end(s)
              
              except Exception as e:
                  tl.error_alert()
